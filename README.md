### 💡 Pro Tips for Success

#### 🔍 AI Detection Techniques
- **Use Magnification Strategically**: Hover/touch-hold for 2.5x zoom with Canvas rendering to examine suspicious areas like hands, eyes, or complex textures
- **Check Human Elements**: AI often struggles with hands (extra fingers), faces (asymmetry), and human interactions
- **Examine Lighting & Shadows**: Look for inconsistent lighting, impossible shadows, or unnatural light sources
- **Study Text & Details**: AI-generated text is usually blurry, nonsensical, or has impossible characters
- **Analyze Textures**: AI has difficulty with complex patterns like fur, fabric weaves, or skin imperfections
- **Trust the "Uncanny Valley"**: If something feels "off" or too perfect, it might be AI

#### ⚡ Strategic Gameplay
- **Balance Speed vs Accuracy**: Time bonuses can add up to 30 points total, but accuracy gives you 60 points
- **Quick Initial Assessment**: Make a gut decision first, then use remaining time to verify with magnification
- **Learn from Timeouts**: The 3-second extended feedback helps you understand AI patterns for future rounds
- **Category-Specific Patterns**: Each category has different AI tells:
  - **Animals**: Unnatural fur, impossible anatomy, weird eyes
  - **Architecture**: Impossible geometry, floating elements, inconsistent perspective
  - **Nature**: Too-perfect landscapes, impossible weather combinations
  - **Food**: Perfect textures, impossible arrangements, unnatural lighting
  - **Products**: Too-perfect surfaces, impossible reflections

### 💡 Pro Tips for Success

#### 🔍 AI Detection Techniques
- **Use Magnification Strategically**: Hover/touch-hold for 2.5x zoom to examine suspicious areas like hands, eyes, or complex textures
- **Check Human Elements**: AI often struggles with hands (extra fingers), faces (asymmetry), and human interactions
- **Examine Lighting & Shadows**: Look for inconsistent lighting, impossible shadows, or unnatural reflections
- **Study Text & Details**: AI-generated text is usually blurry, nonsensical, or has impossible characters
- **Analyze Textures**: AI has difficulty with complex patterns like fur, fabric weaves, or skin imperfections
- **Trust the "Uncanny Valley"**: If something feels "off" or too perfect, it might be AI

#### ⚡ Strategic Gameplay
- **Balance Speed vs Accuracy**: Time bonuses can add up to 30 points total, but accuracy gives you 60 points

### Key Features Implementation

- **Educational System**: Midgame learning breaks with fresh content each session from comprehensive libraries (50 tips, 50 facts)
- **Audio Integration**: Simplified audio system with background music, enhanced sound effects, one-click toggle controls, and initialization tracking
- **Image Magnification**: Advanced magnification system with 2.5x zoom, cursor tracking, responsive sizing, and performance optimization
- **Real-Time Updates**: Realtime connections via Devvit Realtime API for live participant counts and leaderboard updates
- **Timer System**: Client-side 10-second countdown with color-coded visual progress bar (green/yellow/red) and server-side validation
- **Image Handling**: Responsive grid layout with 1:1 aspect ratio, custom overlay indicators, enhanced visual feedback, and interactive magnification
- **Score Calculation**: Tier-based bonus system (5/3/1 points based on remaining time) with server-side validation and whole number scoring
- **Badge Assignment**: Automatic badge calculation based on performance with 5 achievement tiers (6 correct = AI Whisperer, 5 = AI Detective, etc.)
- **Content Management**: Fresh educational content system with random selection from comprehensive libraries and caching
- **Social Sharing**: Native sharing API with clipboard fallback for friend challenges
- **Error Resilience**: Comprehensive error boundaries, network retry logic with exponential backoff, offline detection via `useErrorHandler`
- **Session Management**: Secure Redis-based persistence with local storage caching and session validation
- **Network Optimization**: Smart retry logic with exponential backoff, offline detection, and pending request queuing
- **Loading States**: Comprehensive loading screens, skeleton states, progress indicators, and smooth state transitions
- **Offline Support**: Local caching system for game data, results viewing, cached leaderboards, and graceful degradation

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

### Reddit-Optimized Mobile-First Approach
- **Responsive Grid System**: Images adapt from single column layout on mobile (max-width 400px, centered) to side-by-side comparison at 480px breakpoint (max-width 600px, centered)
- **Reddit Feed Integration**: Breakpoint specifically optimized for Reddit's viewing experience with smaller transition point than typical desktop layouts
- **Touch-Friendly Interface**: Button sizes and spacing optimized for mobile interaction with hover states and scale effects (1.02x hover, 1.05x selection)
- **Consistent Visual Design**: 1:1 aspect ratio maintenance across all screen sizes with 20px border radius and proper image cropping
- **Adaptive Spacing**: 1rem gap on mobile devices, 1.5rem gap on larger screens for optimal visual balance
- **Overlay Consistency**: Custom overlay indicators sized appropriately for each screen size (70px mobile, 80px desktop)
- **Color-Coded Feedback**: Intuitive visual feedback system with green/yellow/red timer and enhanced border styling with glow effects

### User Experience Principles
- **Immediate Feedback**: Visual and audio responses to every user action
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Information revealed at the right time (educational content at midgame)
- **Error Resilience**: Graceful handling of network issues and offline scenarios
- **Accessibility**: High contrast colors, clear typography, and keyboard navigation support
- **Performance**: Optimized loading with caching and efficient state managementlay for mobile networks

### User Experience Focus
- Clear visual feedback with custom overlay indicators and colored borders
- Smooth transitions and loading states with comprehensive error handling
- Intuitive game flow with automatic progression and clear visual hierarchy
- Accessible color schemes (#46E870 green, #F23C3C red) with high contrast for visual feedback

### Performance Optimization
- Efficient API calls with proper error handling and retry logic
- Optimized image loading and caching with graceful degradation
- Minimal bundle sizes for fast loading on Reddit's platform
