# ü§ñ Spot the Bot

**Can you tell AI from reality?**

Spot the Bot is an engaging daily challenge game built on Reddit's Devvit platform where players test their ability to distinguish between real photographs and AI-generated images. Each day brings a fresh set of image pairs across different categories, challenging users to identify which image was created by a human versus artificial intelligence.

This interactive React-based game runs directly within Reddit posts, providing a seamless gaming experience with real-time leaderboards, achievement badges, and social sharing features. Players compete against the clock and each other in a daily test of visual perception and AI detection skills.

## üéØ What is Spot the Bot?

Spot the Bot is a **daily visual challenge game** that tests your ability to distinguish between real photographs and AI-generated images. Built as a React web application that runs natively within Reddit posts using the Devvit platform, the game presents players with side-by-side image comparisons where they must identify which image is authentic.

### Core Game Mechanics
- **5 rounds per game** with exactly 10 seconds per round
- **5 image categories**: Animals, Architecture, Nature, Food, and Products
- **Side-by-side comparison**: Two images displayed simultaneously - one real, one AI-generated
- **Time-pressure scoring**: Faster correct answers earn higher scores with time bonuses (0.01 points per millisecond remaining)
- **One attempt per day**: Each player gets exactly one chance per 24-hour period (resets at 00:00 UTC)
- **Immediate feedback**: See the correct answer and explanation after each round with visual overlays
- **Progressive difficulty**: Mixed categories and randomized AI placement keep players guessing

## üéÆ What Makes This Game Revolutionary

#### Round-by-Round Gameplay

**Round Structure (5 Total Rounds)**
- Each game consists of exactly 5 image comparison rounds
- Categories are mixed across: Animals, Architecture, Nature, Food, and Products
- Category labels are displayed at the top of each round (e.g., "Category: animals")
- Images are presented side-by-side in a responsive grid layout with aspect-square containers
- One image is a real photograph, one is AI-generated (positions are randomized between A and B)
- Round progress is shown as "Round X of 5" at the top

**Making Your Selection**
1. **Analyze Both Images**: You have exactly 10 seconds to study both images carefully
2. **Look for AI Tells**: Check for unnatural lighting, impossible geometry, weird textures, or uncanny valley effects
3. **Click to Choose**: Click on the image you believe is the REAL photograph (not the AI-generated one)
4. **Timer Pressure**: Watch the color-coded countdown timer and progress bar:
   - **Green** (7-10 seconds): Plenty of time to analyze
   - **Yellow** (4-6 seconds): Time to make a decision
   - **Red** (1-3 seconds): Choose quickly!
5. **Automatic Timeout**: If time runs out, the game automatically selects option A as default

**Immediate Feedback**
- After selection, the correct answer is revealed with visual overlays on both images
- Real photos show üì∏ "Real Photo" overlay with white text on black semi-transparent background
- AI images show ü§ñ "AI Generated" overlay with white text on black semi-transparent background
- You see whether you were correct (‚úÖ Correct! or ‚ùå Incorrect) and your round score
- Selected images get a blue border and scale effect, correct answers get green borders
- The game automatically advances to the next round after 2 seconds

#### Scoring System Explained
- **Base Points**: 1 point for each correct identification
- **Time Bonus**: 0.01 bonus points per millisecond remaining when you answer correctly
- **Maximum Possible**: ~101 points per round (1 base + ~100 time bonus for instant correct answers)

### Pro Tips for Success

#### Visual Analysis Techniques
- **Detail Inspection**: AI often struggles with fine details like text, hands, reflections, or complex textures
- **Lighting Consistency**: Look for unnatural lighting, impossible shadows, or inconsistent light sources
- **Geometric Logic**: Check for impossible architecture, floating objects, or perspective errors
- **Texture Realism**: AI-generated textures can appear too perfect or have subtle repetitive patterns
- **Human Elements**: Pay special attention to faces, hands, and human interactions - AI's biggest weakness

#### Strategic Gameplay
- **Trust Your Instincts**: The "uncanny valley" feeling is often a reliable indicator of AI generation
- **Balance Speed vs. Accuracy**: Time bonuses are significant, but accuracy is more important for overall score
- **Category-Specific Patterns**: Each image category has different AI tells:
  - **Animals**: Unnatural fur patterns, impossible anatomy, weird eyes or expressions
  - **Architecture**: Impossible geometry, floating elements, inconsistent perspective
  - **Nature**: Too-perfect landscapes, impossible weather combinations, unnatural colors
  - **Food**: Perfect textures, impossible arrangements, unnatural lighting
  - **Products**: Too-perfect surfaces, impossible reflections, uncanny branding

#### Daily Practice Benefits
- **Pattern Recognition**: Regular play helps you develop better AI detection skills over time
- **Speed Improvement**: Practice helps you make faster, more confident decisions under time pressure
- **Category Familiarity**: Learn the specific tells and patterns for each image category
- **Competitive Edge**: Consistent play helps you climb the weekly and all-time leaderboards
