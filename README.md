# 🤖 Spot the Bot

**Can you tell AI from reality?**

Spot the Bot is an engaging daily challenge game built on Reddit's Devvit platform where players test their ability to distinguish between real photographs and AI-generated images. Each day brings a fresh set of 6 image pairs across 5 different categories (Animals, Architecture, Nature, Food, Products), challenging users to identify which image was created by a human versus artificial intelligence.

This interactive React-based game runs directly within Reddit posts, providing a seamless gaming experience with real-time leaderboards, achievement badges, social sharing features, and simplified audio controls. Players compete against a 10-second timer each round and against each other in a daily test of visual perception and AI detection skills, with up to 2 attempts per day to achieve their best score.

The game features a responsive mobile-first design optimized for Reddit's viewing experience, enhanced visual feedback with custom overlay indicators, simplified audio controls with one-click toggle functionality, comprehensive educational content system, and advanced timeout handling with improved visual feedback and extended learning opportunities.
