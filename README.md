- **Cursor Following**: The magnified circle smoothly follows your mouse cursor in real-time at 60fps with enhanced performance monitoring
- **Responsive Sizing**: Magnification circle automatically adjusts size based on screen size (70px mobile, 80px desktop)
- **Viewport Awareness**: Smart positioning keeps the magnified circle fully visible even near screen edges with safe margins
- **Performance Optimized**: Smooth rendering with automatic performance monitoring, exponential moving average FPS calculation, and intelligent feature disabling on low-performance devices

### Cross-Device Support
- **Desktop**: Smooth mouse hover activation with instant magnification
- **Mobile**: Touch-and-hold gesture (400ms) activates magnification for mobile users with haptic feedback
- **Touch Tracking**: On mobile, drag your finger to move the magnified view around the image
- **Orientation Support**: Handles device rotation and viewport changes seamlessly

### Technical Innovation
- **Canvas Rendering**: High-performance HTML5 Canvas with circular clipping masks and high-quality image smoothing
- **Real-Time Processing**: Live image processing with throttled updates (16ms intervals) for optimal 60fps performance
- **Advanced Performance Monitoring**: Exponential moving average FPS calculation over 3-second intervals with very conservative thresholds (5fps minimum) to prevent false positives while maintaining smooth operation
- **Memory Management**: Efficient cleanup and resource management prevents memory leaks with automatic canvas context cleanup
- **Browser Compatibility**: Works across all modern browsers with graceful fallbacks and comprehensive error handling
- **Intelligent Degradation**: Automatically disables magnification on catastrophically poor performance (below 5fps) while maintaining game functionality

### Strategic Advantages
- **Detail Detection**: Examine fine textures, skin imperfections, and material properties at pixel level
- **AI Artifact Identification**: Spot subtle AI generation artifacts invisible at normal zoom
- **Texture Analysis**: Analyze fabric weaves, fur patterns, and surface details with precision
- **Edge Inspection**: Check for unnatural edges, blending, or impossible geometry

This magnification system transforms how players approach AI detection, enabling detailed forensic analysis while maintaining the fast-paced, competitive nature of the game. The recent performance optimizations ensure smooth operation across all devices while providing intelligent fallbacks for lower-end hardware.

- **Lighting Consistency**: Look for unnatural lighting, impossible shadows, or inconsistent light sources across the imagessible shadows, or inconsistent light sources
- **Geometric Logic**: Check for impossible architecture, floating objects, or perspective errors
- **Human Elements**: Pay special attention to faces, hands, and human interactions - AI often struggles here

#### Strategic Gameplay
- **Trust Your Instincts**: The "uncanny valley" feeling is often a reliable AI indicator
- **Use Magnification Strategically**: Don't spend too much time magnifying - use it to quickly check suspicious areas like hands, eyes, or complex textures with the smooth cursor-following magnification system
- **Balance Speed vs. Accuracy**: Time bonuses can add up to 30 points total (5 points √ó 6 rounds), but accuracy is still most important (60 points total for perfect answers)
- **Category-Specific Patterns**: Each category has different AI tells:
  - **Animals**: Unnatural fur patterns, impossible anatomy, weird eyes (magnify to see individual fur strands)
  - **Architecture**: Impossible geometry, floating elements, inconsistent perspective (magnify structural details)
  - **Nature**: Too-perfect landscapes, impossible weather combinations (magnify natural textures)
