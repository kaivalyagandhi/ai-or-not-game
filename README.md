# 🤖 Spot the Bot

**Can you tell AI from reality?**

Spot the Bot is an engaging daily challenge game built on Reddit's Devvit platform where players test their ability to distinguish between real photographs and AI-generated images. Each day brings a fresh set of image pairs across different categories, challenging users to identify which image was created by a human versus artificial intelligence.

This interactive React-based game runs directly within Reddit posts, providing a seamless gaming experience with real-time leaderboards, achievement badges, social sharing features, and immersive audio. Players compete against the clock and each other in a daily test of visual perception and AI detection skills.

## 🎯 What is Spot the Bot?

Spot the Bot is a **daily visual challenge game** that tests your ability to distinguish between real photographs and AI-generated images. Built as a React web application that runs natively within Reddit posts using the Devvit platform, the game presents players with image comparisons where they must identify which image is the REAL photograph (not the AI-generated one).

### Core Game Mechanics
- **6 rounds per game** with exactly 15 seconds per round
- **6 image categories**: Animals, Architecture, Nature, Food, Products, and Science
- **Responsive layout**: Images displayed vertically on mobile, side-by-side on desktop
- **Time-pressure scoring**: Faster correct answers earn higher scores with time bonuses (0.01 points per millisecond remaining)
- **Multiple attempts per day**: Players can attempt the challenge up to 2 times per day (unlimited in development mode)
- **Educational break**: After round 3, players receive AI detection tips and facts about AI image generation
- **Visual feedback**: Custom overlay indicators show AI vs Human sources with colored borders and icons
- **Audio enhancement**: Background music and sound effects create an immersive gaming experience
- **Progressive difficulty**: Mixed categories and randomized AI placement keep players guessing

## 🎮 What Makes This Game Innovative

### Cutting-Edge AI Detection Challenge
- **Daily Fresh Content**: New image sets generated every day at 00:00 UTC with completely randomized categories, AI placement, and difficulty progression across 6 diverse image categories
- **Real-Time Social Competition**: Live participant counter shows how many players have attempted today's challenge, with real-time updates as new players join via Devvit's Realtime API
- **Intelligent Scoring Algorithm**: Sophisticated time-based scoring system rewards both accuracy (1 point per correct answer) and speed (0.01 bonus points per millisecond remaining), creating strategic tension between careful analysis and quick decisions
- **Educational Integration**: Midgame learning break after round 3 provides AI detection tips and fascinating facts about AI image generation with daily rotating content
- **Immersive Audio Experience**: Background music and contextual sound effects enhance gameplay with user-controlled volume and mute options, gracefully degrading when audio files are unavailable
