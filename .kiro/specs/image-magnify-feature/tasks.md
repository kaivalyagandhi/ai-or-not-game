# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Create core magnification hook and utilities

  - Implement useMagnify hook with cursor position tracking and hover state management
  - Create utility functions for responsive circle sizing and viewport boundary calculations
  - Add performance throttling for smooth 60fps cursor following
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 5.1, 5.2_

- [x] 2. Build canvas-based magnification rendering system

  - Create MagnifyOverlay component with HTML5 Canvas for 3x magnified image rendering
  - Implement circular clipping mask for clean magnified view display
  - Add image loading and error handling for magnification source images
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 1.5, 6.1, 6.2, 6.3_

- [x] 3. Implement MagnifyContainer wrapper component

  - Create container component that wraps game images with magnification functionality
  - Add event handling for mouse hover and touch interactions without interfering with clicks
  - Implement border styling system that matches game's pre-selection border colors
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 4.1, 4.2_

- [x] 4. Add responsive design and cross-device support

  - Implement responsive circle sizing for mobile and desktop layouts
  - Add touch gesture support with touch-and-hold activation for mobile devices
  - Create viewport boundary detection to keep magnified circle fully visible
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5_

- [x] 5. Integrate magnification with GameRound component

  - Modify GameRound component to wrap images with MagnifyContainer
  - Add state management to disable magnification during feedback display
  - Ensure magnification doesn't interfere with existing timer and click functionality
  - _Requirements: 4.3, 4.4, 4.5_

- [x] 6. Add performance optimization and error handling

  - Implement canvas context cleanup and memory management
  - Add performance monitoring with automatic feature disabling on low-performance devices
  - Create graceful degradation when canvas or image loading fails
  - _Requirements: 5.3, 5.4, 5.5_

- [ ]\* 7. Write comprehensive tests for magnification system

  - Create unit tests for useMagnify hook, MagnifyOverlay, and MagnifyContainer components
  - Add integration tests for GameRound component with magnification enabled
  - Write performance tests to verify 60fps rendering and memory usage
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 6.4_

- [ ]\* 8. Add accessibility support and alternative interactions
  - Implement keyboard shortcuts for magnification activation as accessibility alternative
  - Add screen reader announcements for magnification state changes
  - Test compatibility with high contrast themes and color blind accessibility
  - _Requirements: 2.4, 3.1_
