# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Image Magnify Feature enhances the Spot the Bot gameplay experience by providing players with a magnification tool during each round. This feature allows players to hover over either image and see a magnified circular view that follows their cursor, showing a 3x magnified portion of the image area. The magnified circle appears only during hover interactions and uses visual styling consistent with the game's existing design language to maintain a cohesive user experience.

## Glossary

- **Magnify_System**: The complete magnification functionality including hover detection, magnified view rendering, and cursor tracking
- **Magnified_Circle**: The circular overlay that displays the 3x magnified portion of the image
- **Hover_State**: The active state when a user's cursor is positioned over an image area
- **Magnification_Factor**: The 3x zoom level applied to the image portion within the magnified circle
- **Circle_Border**: The visual border around the magnified circle that matches the game's selection border colors
- **Image_Container**: The clickable area containing each image in a game round

## Requirements

5. WHEN switching between portrait and landscape orientations THEN the Magnify_System SHALL maintain proper functionality and sizing

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a player, I want the magnification feature to not interfere with my ability to select images, so that I can examine details and make my choice without accidental interactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks while the magnified circle is visible THEN the Magnify_System SHALL register the click as an image selection
2. WHEN a user hovers over an image THEN the Magnify_System SHALL not prevent or delay the normal click interaction
3. WHEN the 15-second timer is active THEN the Magnify_System SHALL continue to function without affecting timer countdown
4. WHEN a user makes an image selection THEN the Magnify_System SHALL immediately hide the magnified circle
5. WHEN round feedback is displayed THEN the Magnify_System SHALL remain inactive until the next round begins

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a player, I want the magnification feature to perform smoothly without lag, so that I can quickly examine different areas of images within the time limit.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN moving the cursor rapidly across an image THEN the Magnify_System SHALL update the magnified view without noticeable delay
