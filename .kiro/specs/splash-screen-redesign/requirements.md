This specification defines the requirements for redesigning the game's splash screen to feature a "Hot or Not" style split-screen design that is more engaging, arcade-like, and mobile-friendly. The new design will feature golden retriever puppies with colored overlays to immediately convey the game's concept of distinguishing between AI-generated and real images.
