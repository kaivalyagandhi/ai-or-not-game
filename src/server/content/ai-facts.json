    "That AI-generated image of the Pope in a puffy jacket? It fooled millions, including news outlets.",
    "The 'uncanny valley' is that creepy feeling you get when an AI face is almost human, but something is just... off.",
    "AI image generators don't 'think'. They're like super-powered autocomplete for pictures, trained on billions of images from the internet.",
    "Some video game developers now use AI to help create realistic landscapes and characters, saving months of work.",
    "Ever seen a meme that's just a little too weird? It might have been born from an AI meme generator.",
    "AI can now create 'deepfake' videos that are so convincing, they can put words in a politician's mouth or place an actor in a movie they never starred in.",
    "The first AI-generated artwork sold at auction for over $400,000. The art world is still arguing about it.",
    "AI image generation is a 'diffusion' process. The AI starts with digital 'noise' (like TV static) and slowly shapes it into a picture, like a sculptor carving marble.",
    "AI struggles with hands and text for the same reason: they're incredibly complex and have very specific rules that are hard to learn from just looking at pictures.",
    "Some AI models are trained on so much data that they start to learn about the world in surprising ways, like associating certain colors with emotions.",
    "You can 'outpaint' with AI, extending a famous painting like the Mona Lisa to see what might have been just outside the frame.",
    "AI-generated 'people' are being used as virtual influencers on Instagram, with hundreds of thousands of followers.",
    "There are AI tools that can turn your rough sketches into photorealistic images.",
    "AI-generated music is a thing. There are entire albums created by AI, from classical to death metal.",
    "The same text prompt given to an AI image generator will create a different image every single time. It's like rolling a dice with infinite sides.",
    "AI can be used to restore old photos and videos, bringing historical figures to life in stunning detail.",
    "Some sci-fi movie posters from the 70s and 80s look eerily similar to modern AI art, with their surreal and dreamlike imagery.",
    "AI-generated 'art' has won art competitions, causing a huge uproar among human artists.",
    "In the future, video games could have AI-generated missions and stories that are unique to every player.",
    "There are websites that let you create your own AI-generated images just by typing in a few words. The future is now.",
    "AI is getting so good at creating images that there are now AI models that are trained to detect other AI-generated images.",
    "The term 'deepfake' comes from 'deep learning' (the AI technology) and 'fake'.",
    "AI-generated images can have hidden 'watermarks' that are invisible to the human eye but can be detected by a computer.",
    "Some of the most popular AI image generators have names that sound like they're from a sci-fi novel, like 'Midjourney' and 'DALL-E'.",
    "By playing this game, you're not just having fun - you're training your brain to be a more critical consumer of online content. Go you!",
    "AI can dream. Google's DeepDream program, released in 2015, created psychedelic and surreal images by having an AI enhance patterns it found in pictures.",
    "AI can be used to create realistic-looking people who don't exist. This technology is used for everything from creating virtual models to protecting the privacy of people in photos.",
    "AI can be used to generate 3D models from 2D images, which could revolutionize the way we create video games and virtual reality experiences.",
    "There are AI-powered tools that can colorize black and white photos, giving us a new perspective on history.",
    "AI can be used to create 'art' in a variety of styles, from impressionism to pop art to photorealism.",
    "The first computer 'artist' was a program called AARON, which was created in the 1960s and could generate original abstract drawings.",
    "AI can be used to create 'super-resolution' images, taking a low-resolution image and making it look like it was taken with a much better camera.",
    "There are AI models that can generate images from a description of what the image should look like, even if the description is very abstract or creative.",
    "AI can be used to create 'style transfers', taking the style of one image and applying it to another. For example, you could make a photo of your dog look like it was painted by Van Gogh.",
    "AI can be used to create 'generative adversarial networks' (GANs), where two AI models compete against each other to create more realistic images.",
    "AI can be used to create 'neural style transfer', a technique that allows you to apply the style of a famous painting to your own photos.",
    "AI can be used to create 'image inpainting', where you can remove an unwanted object from a photo and have the AI fill in the background.",
    "AI can be used to create 'text-to-image' models, which can generate images from a text description. Some of these models are so powerful that they can create images that are indistinguishable from real photos.",
    "AI can be used to create 'image-to-image' models, which can transform an image in a variety of ways, such as turning a day scene into a night scene or a summer scene into a winter scene.",
    "AI can be used to create 'generative art', which is art that is created by a computer program. Generative art can be used to create everything from abstract patterns to realistic landscapes.",
    "AI can be used to create 'creative coding', which is a type of computer programming that is used to create art and other creative projects.",
