  "tips": [
    "Check the hands and feet: AI models often struggle with generating realistic hands and feet, so look for inconsistencies like extra fingers, distorted limbs, or unnatural poses.",
    "Look for strange patterns in textures: Repetitive or unnatural-looking textures in clothing, skin, or backgrounds can be a tell-tale sign of AI generation.",
    "Examine the eyes: In AI-generated portraits, the eyes may lack the depth and detail of a real photograph. Look for inconsistent reflections or pupils that are perfectly round.",
    "Analyze the lighting and shadows: AI-generated images may have inconsistent lighting, with shadows that don't match the direction of the light source.",
    "Scrutinize the background: Look for objects that are distorted, out of place, or blend into each other in a strange way.",
    "Check for perfect symmetry: Real-world objects and faces are rarely perfectly symmetrical. If an image looks too perfect, it may be AI-generated.",
    "Inspect the text: AI often struggles to generate readable and coherent text. Look for nonsensical words or characters.",
    "Look for a waxy or airbrushed appearance: AI-generated images can sometimes have an overly smooth or plastic-like texture, especially on skin.",
    "Examine the details: Zoom in on the image and look for small details that don't make sense, like misplaced buttons or jewelry that seems to merge with the skin.",
    "Trust your gut: If something feels 'off' or unsettling about an image, it could be a sign that it was generated by AI.",
    "Look for morphed objects: In some AI images, you might see objects that seem to morph into one another in an unnatural way.",
    "Check for repeating elements: AI can sometimes get stuck in a loop and repeat certain elements in the background or in a pattern.",
    "Examine hair and fur: Individual strands of hair or fur may look unrealistic or lack the natural variation of a real photo.",
    "Look for a lack of context: AI-generated images sometimes lack a clear story or context, with objects and people placed in a way that doesn't make sense.",
    "Check for emotional disconnect: While AI is getting better at generating realistic faces, the emotions expressed may not always match the context of the image.",
    "Look for an 'uncanny valley' effect: This is the feeling you get when something looks almost human, but not quite right.",
    "Examine the composition: AI-generated images can sometimes have a strange or unconventional composition that a human photographer would be unlikely to use.",
    "Look for a lack of physics: Objects in an AI-generated image may seem to defy gravity or interact with each other in a way that isn't physically possible.",
    "Check for a 'digital' look: Some AI images have a certain 'digital' quality to them, with colors that are too saturated or a lack of natural grain.",
    "Look for a lack of imperfections: Real photos often have imperfections like lens flare, dust spots, or motion blur. AI images are often too clean.",
    "Scrutinize reflections: Reflections in AI-generated images are often distorted or don't accurately reflect the surrounding environment.",
    "Examine clothing and fabric: The folds and drapes of fabric in an AI image may not look natural.",
    "Look for a lack of narrative: Human-made images often tell a story, while AI-generated images can feel more random and disconnected.",
    "Check for inconsistent styles: An AI image may have different parts of the image rendered in slightly different styles.",
    "Look for a lack of focus: In a real photo, there's usually a clear point of focus, while AI images can sometimes have a uniform level of detail throughout.",
    "Inspect the ears: Just like hands, ears are complex structures that AI can struggle to generate accurately. Look for strange shapes or a lack of detail.",
    "Look for unnatural teeth: AI-generated smiles can sometimes have teeth that are too perfect, unnaturally white, or arranged in a strange way.",
    "Check for misplaced or misshapen accessories: Things like earrings, glasses, and hats might be distorted, asymmetrical, or not sit correctly on a person.",
    "Examine the edges of objects: The boundaries between objects in an AI image can sometimes be blurry or unnaturally sharp.",
    "Look for a lack of variety in crowds: In AI-generated images of crowds, you might see the same face or a limited number of faces repeated.",
    "Check for illogical details: An object might be in a place where it doesn't belong, or it might be a combination of two different objects.",
    "Analyze the perspective: The perspective in an AI-generated image can sometimes be distorted or inconsistent.",
    "Look for a lack of motion: Even in images that are supposed to depict action, AI can sometimes generate a static or frozen look.",
    "Check for strange proportions: The proportions of people or objects in an AI image might be slightly off.",
    "Examine the shadows of small objects: AI can sometimes forget to add shadows to small objects, or the shadows might be in the wrong place.",
    "Look for a lack of brand names or logos: AI models are often trained to avoid generating copyrighted material, so you might see generic or nonsensical logos.",
    "Check for a lack of dirt or wear and tear: Real-world objects usually have some signs of use, while AI-generated objects can look too pristine.",
    "Analyze the way light interacts with transparent objects: AI can struggle to accurately render reflections and refractions in glass or water.",
    "Look for a lack of depth of field: In a real photo, some parts of the image are in focus while others are blurry. AI images can sometimes have a flat, uniform focus.",
    "Check for a lack of individuality in portraits: AI-generated faces can sometimes look generic or like a blend of many different people.",
    "Examine the way clothes fit: The clothes on an AI-generated person might not fit properly or might have strange wrinkles and folds.",
    "Look for a lack of fine detail in the background: While the main subject of an AI image might be detailed, the background can sometimes be blurry or nonsensical.",
    "Check for a lack of interaction between objects: Objects in an AI image might not appear to be physically interacting with each other in a realistic way.",
    "Analyze the way liquids behave: AI can struggle to generate realistic-looking splashes, ripples, or pours.",
    "Look for a lack of cultural context: AI-generated images can sometimes lack the subtle cultural cues and details that you would expect to see in a real photo.",
    "Check for a lack of story in a series of images: If you're looking at a series of AI-generated images, they might not have a coherent narrative or theme.",
    "Examine the way animals are depicted: AI can sometimes generate animals with strange proportions or features.",
    "Look for a lack of complexity in natural scenes: AI-generated landscapes can sometimes lack the natural randomness and complexity of a real scene.",
    "Check for a lack of emotion in animal photos: While AI can generate realistic-looking animals, they might lack the expressive emotions that you would see in a real photo.",
    "Analyze the way food is presented: AI-generated food can sometimes look too perfect or have an unnatural, plastic-like appearance."
