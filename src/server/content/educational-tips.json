  "tips": [
    "Look for unnatural lighting or shadows that don't match the scene - AI often struggles with consistent light sources.",
    "Check hands and fingers carefully - AI frequently generates extra fingers, missing digits, or oddly positioned hands.",
    "Examine text in images - AI-generated text is often blurry, nonsensical, or contains spelling errors.",
    "Notice repetitive patterns or textures that seem too perfect - real photos have natural imperfections.",
    "Look for facial features that seem slightly 'off' - AI may create asymmetrical eyes or unnatural skin textures.",
    "Check reflections and mirrors - AI often fails to create accurate reflections of the scene.",
    "Observe hair details - AI-generated hair may look too smooth, lack individual strands, or have unnatural flow.",
    "Look for objects that blend unnaturally into backgrounds or have unclear edges.",
    "Notice if small details like jewelry, buttons, or accessories appear distorted or incomplete.",
    "Check for consistent perspective - AI sometimes creates objects that don't follow proper perspective rules."
