  "tips": [
    "Look for 'the smudge.' AI sometimes blurs or smudges details where objects meet, like a ring against a finger.",
    "AI still gets hands wrong. Count the fingers. If it looks like a horror movie monster's hand, you've found your tell.",
    "Check for perfect symmetry. Reality is rarely perfect. If a face or building is flawlessly symmetrical, it's a red flag.",
    "Read the text in the background. If it looks like enchanting table language from Minecraft, it's probably AI.",
    "Examine the eyes. AI can make them look glassy, dead, or have bizarre reflections. Real eyes have life.",
    "Weird patterns are a classic AI glitch. Look for repeating textures in fur, fabric, or bricks that don't feel natural.",
    "Lighting is hard. If shadows are going in the wrong direction or a light source is missing, it's a giveaway.",
    "Look for 'waxy' skin. AI sometimes smooths faces so much they look like they're made of plastic.",
    "Physics are optional for AI. Look for floating objects, impossible architecture, or clothing that defies gravity.",
    "The 'uncanny valley' is your friend. If an image just feels 'off' or creepy for no reason, trust your gut.",
    "AI struggles with complexity. A crowd of people might have duplicate faces or weirdly morphed bodies in the background.",
    "Check the ears. Like hands, AI devs haven't quite patched the ear-generation bug yet. Look for strange shapes.",
    "Zoom in! Small details like mismatched earrings, weirdly shaped teeth, or blurry logos can expose the AI.",
    "Look at the hair. AI often creates hair that's either a perfect helmet or a chaotic, stringy mess.",
    "Reflections don't lie. Check mirrors, windows, or water. If the reflection is distorted or missing, you've got it.",
    "AI loves to 'over-render.' Sometimes an image is just too sharp, too perfect, too detailed to be real.",
    "Look for a lack of story. Real photos usually capture a moment. AI images can feel random and disconnected.",
    "Morphed objects are a dead giveaway. Is that a dog-cat? A car-plane? You're looking at an AI.",
    "Edges can be a problem. Look for blurry or unnaturally sharp lines where two objects meet.",
    "Fabric and clothing can be a weak spot. AI might not understand how a shirt should wrinkle or a dress should drape.",
    "Check for consistent style. Sometimes one part of an AI image looks photorealistic and another looks like a painting.",
    "AI is bad at context. A person wearing a winter coat on a sunny beach? Probably AI.",
    "Look for genericism. AI-generated people can sometimes look like a blend of a thousand faces, but with no unique features.",
    "Strange proportions can be a sign. Is someone's arm a little too long? Is a car's wheel a little too small?",
    "Food that looks too perfect is a common AI trait. Real food has blemishes and imperfections.",
    "AI has a hard time with brand logos. It will often generate something that looks like a logo but is just gibberish.",
    "Lack of 'wear and tear' is a good tell. Real-world objects have scratches, dirt, and dust. AI's world is often pristine.",
    "Pay attention to liquids. Splashes, pours, and ripples can look unnatural or frozen in time.",
    "Animal anatomy is tough. AI might give an animal the wrong number of legs or place its ears in a weird spot.",
    "Depth of field can be a clue. AI sometimes makes everything in an image equally sharp, which is rare in photography.",
    "If you see a watermark, it's a good sign it's a real photo from a stock website. AI rarely adds them.",
    "Impossible camera angles can be a tell. If a shot looks like it was taken from a physically impossible position, question it.",
    "Look for a lack of emotion. AI is getting better, but the emotions on a person's face might not match the scene.",
    "AI can get stuck in loops, creating repeating patterns in the background or on clothing.",
    "Sometimes, the most boring image is the real one. AI tends to create visually spectacular images.",
    "Check for a lack of 'soul.' It's hard to define, but real photos often have an emotional core that AI can't replicate.",
    "AI can struggle with anything that requires a deep understanding of the world, like a complex machine or a cultural ceremony.",
    "Look for a 'digital' feel. Some AI images have a certain clean, crisp, almost sterile quality to them.",
    "If it looks like a 'deep dream' image from a few years ago, with weird eyes and psychedelic patterns, it's definitely AI.",
    "AI doesn't understand 'why.' It only understands 'what.' This can lead to images that are technically correct but logically wrong.",
    "A good strategy is to ignore the main subject and focus only on the background for a few seconds.",
    "AI can create things that don't exist. If you see a species of animal you've never seen before, be suspicious.",
    "Look for a lack of motion blur in action shots. Real photos of fast-moving objects usually have some blur.",
    "AI is trained on existing photos, so it can be bad at imagining truly novel concepts.",
    "If the 'photographer' would have been in extreme danger to take the shot (e.g., inside a lion's mouth), it might be AI.",
    "AI can be too literal. A prompt for 'a mouse on a keyboard' might result in a computer mouse sitting on a keyboard.",
    "Look for a lack of interaction between subjects. People in an AI-generated group might not be looking at each other.",
    "AI art often has a 'center-weighted' composition, with the most interesting thing happening right in the middle.",
    "Check the metadata. Sometimes, the filename or image properties can give you a clue (though not in this game!).",
    "Trust your training. The more you play 'AI or Not?', the better your brain will get at spotting the fakes.",
    "Look for misplaced accessories. Glasses might be floating, or a hat might be merging with someone's hair.",
    "AI sometimes struggles with consistent lighting on multiple people in the same scene.",
    "Check for illogical shadows. A person might cast a shadow, but the tree next to them doesn't.",
    "If an image features a very specific, niche meme, it's more likely to be human-made. AI isn't that culturally savvy yet.",
    "Look for a lack of dust, pollen, or other small particles in the air, especially in outdoor scenes.",
    "AI can create 'impossible' colors that don't exist in nature or photography.",
    "Sometimes the AI will 'hallucinate' details that aren't in the prompt, leading to weird, out-of-place objects.",
    "If you're really stuck, try to imagine taking the photo yourself. Does it feel like a real, plausible moment?",
    "Remember, the AI is always learning. The 'tells' of today might be patched in the AI of tomorrow.",
    "Playing 'AI or Not?' is basically like being a digital detective. Put on your thinking cap and look for clues."
